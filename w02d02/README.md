# W02D02 - Asynchronous Control Flow

### To Do
* [x] Blocking Code
* [x] Asynchronous Programming
* [x] `setTimeout` and `setInterval`
* [x] File System Functions (`fs`)

### Synchronous
* code is executed from the top of the file to the bottom

```js
const name = 'Alice';
console.log(name);
```

* ALL sync code will run before async code can start
* async functions DO NOT have return values
